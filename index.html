                <h4>A skaven text adventure</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="textContainer">
                <p class="textArea">
                    <span class="skavenText">The Skaven</span>, sometimes known as the ratmen, the Ratkin, 
                    the "Children of the Horned Rat," or the Underfolk are a malevolent and diabolical race 
                    of large, intelligent humanoid rats that inhabit a massive inter-continental subterranean 
                    empire known in their tongue simply as the <span class="textSpan">"Under-Empire."</span> At the very heart of Skavendom 
                    lies the horrific city of <span class="textSpan">Skavenblight</span>, the ratmen's capital city and the probable 
                    birthplace of the Skaven race.
                </p>
                <p class="textArea tab">
                        The Skaven as a whole are a cruel, treacherous, and highly numerous species that have 
                    since spread their loathsome corruption to the farthest corners of the Known World. From 
                    deep below the earth, these scavengers have built a vast Empire, whose military power and 
                    incomprehensible numbers have the potential to smother the kingdoms of the Old World in a 
                    seething tide of violence and anarchy.
                </p>
                <p class="textArea tab">
                        Out of all the mortal civilisations of the world, no single race, neither the ruthless 
                    Human barbarian tribes of the north nor the savage Greenskins of the east can be compared 
                    in terms of instability to that of the Skaven Under-Empire. The Skaven race as a whole is 
                    extremely divided, often far more divided than perhaps any other race known in existence. 
                    Such disunion and ruthless lack of cooperation stems from the Skaven's insatiable need to 
                    survive, thrive, and reign tyrannically over his brethren.
                </p>
                <p class="textArea tab">
                        To a Skaven, there is no such thing as pity, remorse, compassion, or cooperation. There is 
                    simply survival, survival in a turbulent society that only spares those that possess the 
                    brute strength, extreme cunning, and the vicious instinct to outmaneuver and kill the 
                    opposition, no matter the cost or the body count of either friend or foe. No matter how 
                    divided their race may be, however, they are nonetheless unified in a single cause, and that 
                    cause is to conquer the surface world and bring about the <span class="textSpan">Great Ascendancy</span>, where it is said 
                    that they will swarm across the face of the earth and claim all of it as their own.
                </p>
                <p class="textArea tab">
                        It is believed by all of Skaven-kind that the world is destined to be theirs, for they 
                    consider themselves the Supreme Master Race, undeniably superior in every way to all the 
                    other races of the World. This unwavering belief stems from the promises made by their 
                    horrifically malevolent deity, known by many legendary names, but his most well-known title 
                    is that of the <span class="textSpan">Horned Rat</span>. The Horned Rat is known as the Harbinger of Corruption and Disease,
                    the embodiment of all things the Skaven are or ever will be, and whose worship over the 
                    Under-Empire is both supreme and absolute.
                </p>
                <p class="textArea tab">
                        Within the cruel hierarchy of the Under-Empire, the wishes and demands of the Horned Rat are 
                    issued and maintained by the ruthless tyranny of the <span class="textSpan">Council of Thirteen</span>, an organisation that
                    consists of the twelve most powerful Warlords within the Under-Empire whilst the thirteenth 
                    seat is reserved for the Horned Rat himself. It is due only to the Council's harsh tyranny 
                    that the Under-Empire remained unified in some shape or form for centuries, for none could 
                    ever hope to overcome the legions of warriors the Council has under their iron-fisted rule.

                                Clan Mors is one of the most powerful of the Warlord Clans, 
                                ruled by the equally ruthless Lord Gnawdwell. Due to recent 
                                victories and prodigious expansion, Clan Mors is very near 
                                to matching Clans Eshin, Pestilens, Moulder, and even Skryre 
                                in sheer power and influence. Together, the four Great Clans 
                                might easily crush Mors, much as they have destroyed other 
                                upstart clans in the past. Yet Mors continues to flaunt its 
                                power, and none are certain why the Great Clans have failed 
                                to act as they are expected to.

                                Under-Empire, and it specialises in the creation of some 
                                of the most horrific and fearsome war-beasts to have ever 
                                existed through breeding, mutation, and surgical alteration.

                                Such is the demand for these ferocious creations that Clan 
                                Moulder is one of the wealthiest of all Skaven clans. While
                                many are jealous of Clan Moulder's might and wealth, few 
                                dare to openly challenge them, not when the clan can field 
                                an entire army of grotesquely mutated war-beasts.

                                Clan Skryre is one of the four Skaven Great Clans. Its

                                with mad science and engineering to create some of the 
                                greatest and most diabolical warmachines to have ever 
                                graced the tunnels of the great Under-Empire. Its members, 
                                known as Warlock-Engineers are both inventors and magicians 
                                alike, whose expertise aids in the manufacturing of all 
                                kinds of War-machines and weaponry for the use of those 
                                willing to pay. Many of them are full-fledged wizards 
                                themselves, capable of manipulating the Winds of Magic to 
                                cast spells on their own, but their most potent of weapons 
                                lies in their use of their own deadly weaponry

                                and plagues these ratmen have created, mastered and unleashed 
                                upon the world. Probably the most feared out of all the Great 
                                Clans, these Skaven are feared by their enemies and allies alike, 
                                having been the main aggressor and instigator of both of the two 
                                great Skaven Civil Wars that ravaged much of the Under-Empire for 
                                four centuries, and almost succeeded in overthrowing the Council
